# Assignment-01
*NOTE:* This is important.
<span style="color:red">NOTE: Respected Sir,
I faced some issues with my Windows version, so I completed my assignment using an online compiler.
I have added the code in the README file on GitHub for submission.</span>

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a1=2;
    int b2=4;
    int sum=a1+b2;
    cout<<sum<<endl;
    int sub=a1-b2;
    cout<<sub<<endl;
    int mul=a1*b2;
    cout<<mul<<endl;
    int div=a1/b2;
    cout<<div<<endl;    
}
